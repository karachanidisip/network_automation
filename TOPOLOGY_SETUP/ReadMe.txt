This script aims to automate the IP addresses and sub-interface configuration for cisco devices in a topology with 10 Routers.
The physical topology consist of devices interconnected over a switch using the same interface (eg Ethernet0/1).
The logical topology makes use of sub-interfaces and dot1q encapsulation, so you can create ANY kind of logical topology.

LIMITATIONS
The hostmane and the management address of the devices CANNOT be changed!
